    <h3>Online betting should be included as scheduled offences under PMLA</h3>
    <p>
      Online betting and gambling activities should be included as scheduled
      offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, to
      strengthen India's anti-money laundering framework, an institution under
      the Ministry of Home Affairs said in its report titled ‘Curbing betting
      and gambling in India—A national security imperative’.PMLA equips
      authorities with robust tools to investigate and trace illicit proceeds
      from online betting and gambling empowering them to disrupt the financial
      networks supporting these activities effectively. “Once online betting and
      gambling activities are classified as scheduled offence under PMLA or are
      prohibited under regulatory frameworks, necessary international
      cooperation agreements should be entered into with jurisdictions where the
      majority of these platforms operate, such as Cyprus and Malta.
      Additionally, enforcement authorities should collaborate with
      international law enforcement agencies to issue arrest warrants and take
      appropriate legal actions,” the Rashtriya Raksha University report said.
      Rashtriya Raksha University under the Ministry of Home Affairs was
      established by the Parliament Act No. 31 in 2020. It aims to become an
      academic-research-training ecosystem for national security and police

    <h3>FY25 results</h3>
    <p>
      Betala Global Securities, Gautam Gems, Golkonda Aluminium Extrusions, HCL
      Technologies, Indo Cotspin, Infomedia Press,Indian Renewable Energy
      Development Authority (IREDA), JIK Industries, Oriental Hotels, Setco
      Automotive, Teamo Productions HQ and Vipul Ltd. will declare Q1 results on
      July 12. According to a Mint report, HCL Technologies is expected to
      report a revenue decline of ~2% on a quarter-on-quarter basis due to
      seasonal issues attributed to annual productivity pass-backs to clients,
      and a few planned ramp-downs in the IT services business. Its margin is
      expected to contract by 80 bps quarter on quarter basis due to seasonal
      changes. The company will most likely maintain its FY25 revenue growth
      guidance of 3-5%.

      Scientists use cosmic rays to study twisters and other severe storms
    </h3>
    <p>
      Conventional tornado-tracking instrumentation relies on measurements made
      by technologies like drones or weather balloons, but those methods often
      require humans to get dangerously close to the path of an oncoming storm.
      Yet through studying how these storms affect muons, which are heavier than
      electrons and travel through matter at nearly the speed of light, these
      findings can act as another tool for scientists to gain a more accurate
      picture of underlying weather conditions.

      Popular climate assessment method can be enhanced to improve tipping point
      accuracy
    </h3>
    <p>
      The optimal fingerprinting method (OFM) has been used extensively to
      detect and attribute the effects of climate change. A recent analysis of
      the various assumptions used by OFM has revealed several ways the method
      could be improved to enhance its usefulness and accuracy, particularly in
      the assessment of climate tipping points. Earth's climate system is
      complex, and understanding the dynamics and causes of climate change is
      equally complex. Climate scientists have leveraged the fingerprinting
      method to determine whichclimate signals are natural and which are
      man-made.

      Chemists develop robust molecule that gives organic electronic devices a
      boost
    </h3>
    <p>
      RIKEN chemists have developed a molecule that enhances the performance of
      organic electronic devices and is also more stable than previous
      alternatives, raising the chances that it could be used in industrial
      manufacturing processes. The study is published in Advanced Materials.
      Conventional electronic devices are made from hard semiconductors such as
      silicon, but increasingly organic semiconductor molecules are appearing in
      devices such as televisions and cell-phone displays that use organic
      light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

      Four crucial climate targets the new UK government should adopt
      immediately
    </h3>
    <p>
      The UK is not on track to meet its climate targets and has no credible
      pathway to get there. However, a new set of more specific targets would
      provide some clarity for the country's new government and would ultimately
      help achieve the overall goal: prevent further climate change. I
      contributed to a new report by the Climate Evidence Unit at the University
      of Leeds in which we suggest four additional climate targets.

    <h3>New research reveals how galaxies avoid early death</h3>
    <p>
      Galaxies avoid an early death because they have a "heart and lungs" which
      effectively regulate their "breathing" and prevent them from growing out
      of control, a new study suggests. If they didn't, the universe would have
      aged much faster than it has and all we would see today is huge "zombie"
      galaxies teeming with dead and dying stars. That's according to a new
      study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,
      which investigates one of the great mysteries of the universe—why galaxies
      are not as large as astronomers would expect.

      There have been remarkable advancements in the development of artificial
      intelligence (AI) in the last few years. Foundation models, which are
      trained on a broad set of unlabelled data that can be used for different
      tasks, with minimal fine-tuning like OpenAI's ChatGPT, have become the
      technological base for creators and entrepreneurs to develop customised
      and targeted AI solutions and have attracted significant interest and
      investments. Predictably, the widespread use of AI, has also presented
      regulators with questions surrounding the ethical use of AI and affixing
      accountability for its potential misuse. In this context, competition
      regulators worldwide have started to examine whether the proliferation of
      AI foundation models could distort competitive conditions in the
      marketplace and the Indian market regulator- the Competition Commission of
      India (CCI), is no exception.

    <h3>The ascent of MNC funds and their top midcap bets</h3>
    <p>
      MNC (multi-national corporation) mutual fund schemes have done well over
      the last 12-15 months. These funds ranked second among sector and theme
      funds in terms of performance, after infrastructure funds. Over the last
      one year, the Nifty MNC total return index (TRI) gained 42 percent while
      the Nifty 50 TRI gave 27 percent. Five mutual fund schemes invest
      predominantly in MNCs that get their major revenue from domestic and
      international operations.These companies typically have a strong
      parentage, robust export stories, and high standards of corporate
      governance, distinguishing them as stronger entities within the broader
      market index. Roshan Chutkey, Fund manager of ICICI Prudential MNC Funds,
      says: “The MNC theme has performed well due to the underlying strengths of
      the businesses in the MNC index. Notably, the industrials and capital
      goods sector, which forms a significant part of the MNC theme, have shown
      a remarkable performance over the past three years due to the strong order
      book growth. The outlook for these companies aligns with the broader
      market perspective. Investing in MNC funds offers the dual benefits of
      solid corporate governance and resilient business practices. However, due
      to the current high valuations, it is advisable to strategically time
      investments to maximise long-term opportunities, adds Chutkey. Here are
      top 10 midcap stocks among the five MNC schemes in India.
